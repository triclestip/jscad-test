# jscad-starter
A simple, empty starter project for JSCAD. It auto-rebuilds all STLs on any change.

**Problem: I'm using this project as base for any new JSCAD projects, as it is intended to be used. But, after checkout, the GIT origin is wrong and still pointing to this repo. How can I change that?**
